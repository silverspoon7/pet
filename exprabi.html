                    <p class="britishtext">The term rex rabbit (without capitalization) refers informally to one of at least nine breeds of domestic rabbit (or a specimen thereof or similar thereto). One such breed is the Rex, which is recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA)[1] and by the British Rabbit Council (BRC).[2] Other modern-day rex rabbit breeds are listed below. Care must be taken to distinguish the rex rabbit breeds from the three types of rex rabbit fur for which they are known.

                        The Rex rabbit breed that is (along with nine other rex rabbit breeds) recognized by ARBA is a medium-sized rabbit with a commercial, round body and an ideal weight range of 7.5–10.5 pounds (3.4–4.8 kg).[3] The Rex has a slightly broader head than other breeds of rabbit, proportionate upright ears, and proportionally smaller feet. As with most larger breeds, the female (or doe) has a dewlap, a large flap of skin under the chin. And nose flap.</p>

                        <p class="mainetext">The Netherland Dwarf is a breed of domestic rabbit that originated in the Netherlands. Weighing 1.1–2.5 pounds (0.50–1.13 kg),[1][2] the Netherland Dwarf is one of the smallest rabbit breeds. Its popularity as a pet or show rabbit may stem from its neotenic appearance. The Netherland Dwarf is recognised by both the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA)[1] and the British Rabbit Council (BRC).[2] The Netherland Dwarf is often confused with the Polish breed of rabbit, but the latter has longer ears, a non-brachycephalic head and less cobbiness.</p>

                            <h5 class="card-title">Dutch Rabbit</h5>
                            <p class="ragdolltext">The Dutch rabbit, also known as Hollander or Brabander is easily identifiable by its characteristic colour pattern, and was once the most popular of all rabbit breeds. However, after dwarf rabbits were developed, the popularity of the Dutch rabbit dwindled. Nevertheless, the Dutch rabbit remains one of the top ten most popular breeds worldwide.[1]

                                "Although the name suggests that the Dutch rabbit is from the Netherlands, it was actually developed in England. During the 1830s rabbits were imported to England from Ostend in Belgium every week for the meat market. Amongst these rabbits was a breed known as the Petit Brabançon, as it originated from Brabant in Flanders. The Petit Brabançon may still be found in paintings from the fifteenth century. The Dutch rabbit has its genetic roots in this old breed. The Petit Brabançon would often display Dutch markings, and breeders in England selected those with even markings, fixing those markings into the breed we know today."[2]
                                
                                Dutch are popular both as pets and among show breeders.</p>

                            <p class="boertext">Not to be confused with Miniature Lop.
                                The Mini Lop is a breed of domestic rabbit that is recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA).[1] It is different from the Miniature Lop breed that is recognized by the British Rabbit Council (BRC).[2] (In the UK, the Miniature Lop is sometimes called—for short—the "Mini Lop".) The Mini Lop [US] and the Miniature Lop [UK] are different from the Dwarf Lop breed that is recognized by the BRC[2] (but not ARBA).[1] The Mini Lop is similar to several other small rabbit breeds, such as the Dwarf rabbit.</p>
